                    <h2>About Foodback</h2>

                    <p>
                        Foodback is a new initiative to empower people for healthier community food places.
                        It involves the development of a smartphone app for crowdsourcing data on the healthiness of foods advertised and sold in local community settings (i.e., schools, hospitals, supermarkets, takeaways, sport clubs) and outdoors (i.e., around schools).
                        The results will be fed back automatically to local ‘change agents’ (such as local Government representatives, local Members of Parliament, schools, retailers, sport clubs,..) in the form of health star ratings.
                        This way, settings and communities can be compared against each other, and people can encourage and support local ‘change agents’ to make positive, healthy changes to foods advertised and sold in their community.
                        Registration information will include: sex, age, ethnicity, community, email, and mobile phone number.
                        Your location based on your mobile device will also be captured.
                        You will also be required to use your mobile device’s camera for this application.

                    <h2>Please read through</h2>

                    <p>
                        I have understood the nature and aims of the Foodback initiative and why I am invited to contribute.
                        I have had the opportunity to ask questions and have them answered to my satisfaction.
                        I have had sufficient time to think about using the app and to talk about it with the person(s) of my choice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I agree to take part in the collection of data related to my local community
                        food environment through this Foodback smartphone application including 8 different features
                        (‘your supermarket’, ‘your fast food’, ‘your food outlets’, ‘your school food zone’, ‘your hospital, ‘your community, ‘your sport clubs and events’ and ‘your activity environment’)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I accept that no reimbursement of working hours or travel costs will be made for my contribution in this initiative
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I understand that the time I invest in the Foodback initiative for creating healthier food environments is completely up to me
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I understand that I am free to withdraw participation at any time and to
                        withdraw any data collected by me from the online web platform.
                        In order to withdraw any data collected by me, I have to send an email
                        request to foodback@auckland.ac.nz
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I understand that the data collected by me will be confidential and no
                        personal data and details will be posted on the interactive Foodback website platform.
                        Only summary data on schools, retailers and sport clubs in my community will be accessible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        No identifiable information from participants will be reported in any format,
                        whether through the online web platform, feedback to local stakeholders or through publication of the findings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I understand that the data collected by me will be kept in order to make comparisons between communities and over time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I agree not to execute any pressure on schools or retailers to participate
                        in the study and to leave those properties whenever requested to do so.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I understand that for the Foodback app features related to ‘Your school food zone’ or ‘Your workplace’,
                        I have to ask a representative to sign an online consent form (realsignatures to be collected through smartphone or tablet) with mention
                        of the role of the person who signs,
                        before they collect any data through the smartphone application about the environment and the nutrition policy.
                        These signed consent forms will be automatically posted, registered and stored on the web platform,
                        so that the researchers can keep track of the premises that have given consent.
                        For private sector settings and other public sector settings not mentioned in the uploaded list,
                        it will be possible to add them, together with their address, signed consent form and role of the signing person onto the same website.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I will not upload pictures which also have individuals photographed on them.
                        These pictures will be deleted from the database if they contain (parts of)
                        individuals.
